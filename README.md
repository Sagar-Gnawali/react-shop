# React Shop Product Viewer

This project is a React application built with TypeScript that displays a list of products and detailed product information fetched from the live API at [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/products). The project demonstrates how to integrate a live API, implement routing, and use TypeScript for type safety.
